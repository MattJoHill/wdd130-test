        <h3>The Sun's Heat (Acryllic Painting)</h3>
        <p>
          This was a simple painting I made for a class project. It involved
          creating a composition that involved 6 flat dynamic shapes, and then
          overlaying different patterns on top of each one. I enjoyed the focal
          point I was able to create through the use of line and contrast here.

        <h3>Self Portrait (Graphite)</h3>
        <p>
          It's me! I'm still not overly confident in my ability to draw, but I
          was relatively happy with how this turned out. My hair isn't exactly
          easy to draw as it's typically pretty messy, but I enjoyed the process
          of working through this and learning techniques that go into
          portraiture quite a bit!

        <h3>Cutting Fruit (Graphite)</h3>
        <p>
          This was a still life drawing where I focused on shading. I started
          with a picture I took and examined the lighting and shadows
          throughout. It was extremely interesting to learn how light works on
          this small scale project. I also liked working with these organic
          shapes of the strawberry and banana that I had cut up. (Not to mention
          they were delicious after the camera was put away too!)
