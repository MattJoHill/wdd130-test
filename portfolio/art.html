      <h3>The Sun's Heat (Acryllic Painting)</h3>
      <p>
        This was a simple painting I made for a class project. It involved
        creating a composition that involved 6 flat dynamic shapes, and then
        overlaying different patterns on top of each one. I enjoyed the focal
        point I was able to create through the use of line and contrast here.

      <h3>Self Portrait (Graphite)</h3>
      <p>
        It's me! I'm still not overly confident in my ability to draw, but I was
        relatively happy with how this turned out. My hair isn't exactly easy to
        draw as it's typically pretty messy, but I enjoyed the process of
        working through this and learning techniques that go into portraiture
        quite a bit!

      <h3>Cutting Fruit (Graphite)</h3>
      <p>
        This was a still life drawing where I focused on shading. I started with
        a picture I took and examined the lighting and shadows throughout. It
        was extremely interesting to learn how light works on this small scale
        project. I also liked working with these organic shapes of the
        strawberry and banana that I had cut up. (Not to mention they were
        delicious after the camera was put away too!)
