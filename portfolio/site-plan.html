        Hey! My name is Matt Hill, I'm a Graphic Designer and wannabe artist. Thanks for checking out my site to look at my work! I have quite a bit of my work here for you to see, and if you'd like to know more, feel free to reach out! You can reach me...

      <h3>[Page 2] - Graphic Design</h3>
      <p>
        KLINT POSTER: This is a poster I made as if I was hired by myfonts.com to create a poster advertising the font "Klint." I was really happy with how it turned out! I enjoyed working on a much larger scale project. It was great learning how to work with allignment and hierarchy of scale.

        BUSINESS CARD: Here is the design for my current business card! It is focused on typography and getting the necessary information across. However, as this is simply a proof of concept, none of the information is actually accurate at this time, so if you call or text those numbers, or look up the instagram, it's not actually owned by me, as they are just placeholders for now.

        BOOKLET: I was able to make a typographic pamphlet centered around a talk that I really enjoyed from Elder Garret W. Gong. I learned a great deal about how to structure different pages and generally how to construct an easy to read pamphlet. Love is Spoken Here is a talk given by Elder Garret W. Gong of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. It was given at the October 2023 session of the semi-annual General Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I love this talk because it speaks about belonging and helping others to be cared for.

        PAINTING: This was a simple painting I made for a class project. It involved creating a composition that involved 6 flat dynamic shapes, and then overlaying different patterns on top of each one. I enjoyed the focal point I was able to create through the use of line and contrast here.

        SELF PORTRAIT: It's me! I'm still not overly confident in my ability to draw, but I was relatively happy with how this turned out. My hair isn't exactly easy to draw as it's typically pretty messy, but I enjoyed the process of working through this and learning techniques that go into portraiture quite a bit!

        STILL LIFE: This was a still life drawing where I focused on shading. I started with a picture I took and examined the lighting and shadows throughout. It was extremely interesting to learn how light works on this small scale project. I also liked working with these organic shapes of the strawberry and banana that I had cut up. (Not to mention they were delicious after the camera was put away too!)

      <h3>[Page 4] - About Me</h3>
      <p>
        WHO ARE YOU?: I'm just your run of the mill college student if you're looking for the simple answer. But if you're looking for a longer answer, you're in luck! I call myself a Professional Amateur at many things. I love learning and trying to get better at the things I know. Here's an image of me working on some digital sketches.

        Outside of art I enjoy the outdoors and nature. Here is an image of me on a hike that I recently went on, there are some beautiful mountains that make for great hikes around Idaho. That's where I currently am! Attending college at BYU-Idaho.

        I also love the cold up here. It does get a little much some years, but never enough to make me regret living here, that's for sure. I love hanging out with friends and co-workers, as well as the satisfaction of a finished job I can be proud of. If you'd like to get in contact with me so we can work together, feel free to connect and contact me! Here are the best ways to do that:
