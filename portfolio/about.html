      <h2>Matt Hill</h3>
      <p>I'm just your run of the mill college student if you're looking for the simple answer. But if you're looking for a longer answer, you're in luck! I call myself a Professional Amateur at many things. I love learning and trying to get better at the things I know. Here's an image of me working on some digital sketches. Outside of art I enjoy the outdoors and nature. Here is an image of me on a hike that I recently went on, there are some beautiful mountains that make for great hikes around Idaho. That's where I currently am! Attending college at BYU-Idaho.</p>

      <p>I also love the cold up here. It does get a little much some years, but never enough to make me regret living here, that's for sure. I love hanging out with friends and co-workers, as well as the satisfaction of a finished job I can be proud of. If you'd like to get in contact with me so we can work together, feel free to connect and contact me! Here are the best ways to do that: CONTACT INFORMATION </p>
