          I'm just your run of the mill college student if you're looking for
          the simple answer. But if you're looking for a longer answer, you're
          in luck! I call myself a Professional Amateur at many things. I love
          learning and trying to get better at the things I know. Here's an
          image of me working on some digital sketches. Outside of art I enjoy
          the outdoors and nature. Here is an image of me on a hike that I
          recently went on, there are some beautiful mountains that make for
          great hikes around Idaho. That's where I currently am! Attending
          college at BYU-Idaho.

          I also love the cold up here. It does get a little much some years,
          but never enough to make me regret living here, that's for sure. I
          love hanging out with friends and co-workers, as well as the
          satisfaction of a finished job I can be proud of. If you'd like to get
          in contact with me so we can work together, feel free to connect and
          contact me! Here are the best ways to do that: CONTACT INFORMATION
